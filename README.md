# Hybrid Recommendations for Movie Ratings
This project is inspired by the paper *Movie Recommendation System Using Item Based Collaborative Filtering* by Sharma & Yadav (2020). 

In this project we applied three types of recommendation systems to a movie ratings dataset:
- Content-based filtering
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- A hybrid algorithm successively applying both of the above algorithms
